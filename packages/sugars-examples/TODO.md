# Plan for JSON Object Syntax Implementation

## Objective
Make the EXACT syntax from README.md work: `{"key" => "value"}` without any visible macros in the example code. The examples must compile and run with the clean JSON syntax shown in the documentation.

## Current Status
- ✅ Created sugars-examples package structure
- ✅ Created ai_builder.rs with builder implementations
- ✅ Created example file with exact README syntax
- ❌ The syntax doesn't compile yet - needs macro support in builders

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Import hash_map_fn! macro in ai_builder.rs implementation
- **Task**: Add import for sugars_macros::collections::hashbrown::hash_map_fn at the top of ai_builder.rs
- **Reminder**: Don't change the examples, change the builder
- **Warning**: DO NOT MOCK, FABRICATE, FAKE or SIMULATE ANY OPERATION or DATA. Make ONLY THE MINIMAL, SURGICAL CHANGES required. Do not modify or rewrite any portion of the app outside scope.

### 2. QA: Verify macro import is correct
- **Task**: Act as an Objective QA Rust developer and verify the macro import path is correct and the macro is accessible from the ai_builder.rs module. Rate the work performed on a scale of 1-10.

### 3. Create impl_json_builder! macro for wrapping impl blocks
- **Task**: Create a macro that wraps entire impl blocks and transforms method signatures to handle JSON syntax
- **Details**: This macro should transform methods that accept `{"key" => "value"}` syntax by internally applying hash_map_fn!
- **Reminder**: Don't change the examples, change the builder
- **Warning**: DO NOT MOCK, FABRICATE, FAKE or SIMULATE ANY OPERATION or DATA. Make ONLY THE MINIMAL, SURGICAL CHANGES required. Do not modify or rewrite any portion of the app outside scope.

### 4. QA: Verify impl_json_builder! macro correctness
- **Task**: Act as an Objective QA Rust developer and verify the impl_json_builder! macro correctly transforms method signatures and preserves all attributes, visibility modifiers, and generics. Rate the work performed on a scale of 1-10.

### 5. Apply impl_json_builder! to Client impl block
- **Task**: Wrap the Client impl block with the macro to enable JSON syntax for with_headers and with_options methods
- **Reminder**: Don't change the examples, change the builder
- **Warning**: DO NOT MOCK, FABRICATE, FAKE or SIMULATE ANY OPERATION or DATA. Make ONLY THE MINIMAL, SURGICAL CHANGES required. Do not modify or rewrite any portion of the app outside scope.

### 6. QA: Test Client builder with JSON syntax
- **Task**: Act as an Objective QA Rust developer and verify that Client::new().with_headers({"Authorization" => "Bearer token123"}) compiles and works correctly. Rate the work performed on a scale of 1-10.

### 7. Apply impl_json_builder! to Database impl block
- **Task**: Wrap the Database impl block to enable JSON syntax for the connect method
- **Reminder**: Don't change the examples, change the builder
- **Warning**: DO NOT MOCK, FABRICATE, FAKE or SIMULATE ANY OPERATION or DATA. Make ONLY THE MINIMAL, SURGICAL CHANGES required. Do not modify or rewrite any portion of the app outside scope.

### 8. QA: Test Database::connect with JSON syntax
- **Task**: Act as an Objective QA Rust developer and verify that Database::connect({"host" => "localhost", "port" => "5432"}) compiles and works correctly. Rate the work performed on a scale of 1-10.

### 9. Apply impl_json_builder! to ApiClient impl block
- **Task**: Wrap the ApiClient impl block to enable JSON syntax for auth and rate_limit methods
- **Reminder**: Don't change the examples, change the builder
- **Warning**: DO NOT MOCK, FABRICATE, FAKE or SIMULATE ANY OPERATION or DATA. Make ONLY THE MINIMAL, SURGICAL CHANGES required. Do not modify or rewrite any portion of the app outside scope.

### 10. QA: Test ApiClient builder with JSON syntax
- **Task**: Act as an Objective QA Rust developer and verify that ApiClient methods with JSON syntax compile and work correctly. Rate the work performed on a scale of 1-10.

### 11. Handle edge cases in macro implementation
- **Task**: Ensure the macro handles all edge cases: empty objects {}, trailing commas, nested values if needed
- **Reminder**: Don't change the examples, change the builder
- **Warning**: DO NOT MOCK, FABRICATE, FAKE or SIMULATE ANY OPERATION or DATA. Make ONLY THE MINIMAL, SURGICAL CHANGES required. Do not modify or rewrite any portion of the app outside scope.

### 12. QA: Test edge cases thoroughly
- **Task**: Act as an Objective QA Rust developer and verify all edge cases work correctly. Test empty objects, single entries, multiple entries, trailing commas. Rate the work performed on a scale of 1-10.

### 13. Run the ai_agent_builder example
- **Task**: Execute `cargo run --package sugars-examples --example ai_agent_builder` and verify it compiles and runs successfully
- **Reminder**: Don't change the examples, change the builder
- **Warning**: DO NOT MOCK, FABRICATE, FAKE or SIMULATE ANY OPERATION or DATA. Make ONLY THE MINIMAL, SURGICAL CHANGES required. Do not modify or rewrite any portion of the app outside scope.

### 14. QA: Verify example output matches expectations
- **Task**: Act as an Objective QA Rust developer and verify the example runs without errors and produces the expected output showing successful JSON syntax usage. Rate the work performed on a scale of 1-10.

### 15. Document the macro implementation
- **Task**: Add comprehensive documentation comments to the macro explaining how it enables the JSON syntax
- **Reminder**: Don't change the examples, change the builder
- **Warning**: DO NOT MOCK, FABRICATE, FAKE or SIMULATE ANY OPERATION or DATA. Make ONLY THE MINIMAL, SURGICAL CHANGES required. Do not modify or rewrite any portion of the app outside scope.

### 16. QA: Review documentation completeness
- **Task**: Act as an Objective QA Rust developer and verify the documentation clearly explains the implementation without exposing complexity to users. Rate the work performed on a scale of 1-10.

### 17. Clean up temporary files and unused code
- **Task**: Remove json_syntax.rs, macros.rs, prelude.rs and any other temporary files created during experimentation
- **Reminder**: Don't change the examples, change the builder
- **Warning**: DO NOT MOCK, FABRICATE, FAKE or SIMULATE ANY OPERATION or DATA. Make ONLY THE MINIMAL, SURGICAL CHANGES required. Do not modify or rewrite any portion of the app outside scope.

### 18. QA: Verify cleanup is complete
- **Task**: Act as an Objective QA Rust developer and verify all temporary files are removed and only necessary code remains. Rate the work performed on a scale of 1-10.

### 19. Final integration test
- **Task**: Run all tests and examples to ensure nothing is broken and the JSON syntax works seamlessly
- **Reminder**: Don't change the examples, change the builder
- **Warning**: DO NOT MOCK, FABRICATE, FAKE or SIMULATE ANY OPERATION or DATA. Make ONLY THE MINIMAL, SURGICAL CHANGES required. Do not modify or rewrite any portion of the app outside scope.

### 20. QA: Final comprehensive review
- **Task**: Act as an Objective QA Rust developer and perform a final review of the entire implementation. Verify that the README.md syntax works exactly as shown without any visible macros in user code. Rate the overall implementation on a scale of 1-10.

## Success Criteria
