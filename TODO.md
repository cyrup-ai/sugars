# Production Quality Cyrup Sugars Completion Plan

## VERIFICATION: Macro Privacy Status âœ…
- README.md: No macro exposure (mentions feature but no usage examples)
- examples/: No macro usage in any example files  
- lib.rs: Macros not re-exported at crate level
- All macros remain private implementation details
