# The Complete Guide to cargo-hakari for Rust Dependency Management

## What is cargo-hakari and why it matters

Cargo-hakari is a command-line tool that automates the creation and maintenance of "workspace-hack" crates to dramatically improve build times in Rust workspaces. By unifying dependency features across all workspace members, it eliminates redundant compilation of the same dependencies with different feature sets, achieving up to **100x speedups for individual commands** and **1.7x cumulative build time improvements**.

### The problem it solves

In Rust workspaces, different crates often depend on the same external library but with different feature sets:

```toml
# crate-a/Cargo.toml
[dependencies]
serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }

# crate-b/Cargo.toml  
[dependencies]
serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["rc"] }

# crate-c/Cargo.toml
[dependencies]
serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive", "rc", "alloc"] }
```

Without hakari, Cargo may compile serde multiple times with different feature combinations, leading to slower builds and increased disk usage. Cargo-hakari solves this by creating a unified workspace-hack crate that forces consistent feature resolution across all builds.

## Installing cargo-hakari

### Primary installation method
```bash
cargo install cargo-hakari --locked
```

### Alternative installation methods
```bash
# Using cargo-binstall (faster)
cargo binstall cargo-hakari

# In GitHub Actions
- name: Install cargo-hakari
  uses: taiki-e/install-action@v2
  with:
    tool: cargo-hakari

# Download pre-built binaries
# Visit: https://github.com/guppy-rs/guppy/releases
```

**System Requirements:**
- Rust 1.82 or later (MSRV)
- Full support on Unix/Linux/macOS
- Windows supported (with forward slash paths)

## Configuring and initializing hakari

### Step 1: Prerequisites
```bash
# Add Cargo.lock to version control (required)
git add Cargo.lock
git commit -m "Add Cargo.lock for hakari"

# Ensure resolver v2 in workspace Cargo.toml
[workspace]
resolver = "2"
```

### Step 2: Initialize workspace-hack
```bash
# Initialize with default name
cargo hakari init

# Or specify custom path
cargo hakari init --path my-workspace-hack
```

### Step 3: Configure hakari
Create or edit `.config/hakari.toml`:

```toml
# Basic configuration
hakari-package = "workspace-hack"
resolver = "2"
dep-format-version = "4"

# Platform optimization
platforms = [
    "x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu",
    "x86_64-apple-darwin",
    "x86_64-pc-windows-msvc",
]

# Advanced options
unify-target-host = "auto"  # Best performance
output-single-feature = false

# Exclusions
[traversal-excludes]
workspace-members = ["test-crate"]
third-party = [
    { name = "criterion" },  # Benchmark-only
]

[final-excludes]
third-party = [
    { name = "fail" },  # Common test crate
]

# Custom registries
[registries]
internal = { index = "https://internal.example.com/index" }
```

### Step 4: Generate and apply
```bash
# Generate workspace-hack content
cargo hakari generate

# Add workspace-hack dependency to all crates
cargo hakari manage-deps
```

## Using hakari for dependency management

### Adding new dependencies

1. Add to your crate's `Cargo.toml`:
```toml
[dependencies]
reqwest = { version = "0.11", features = ["json"] }
```

2. Update hakari:
```bash
cargo hakari generate
cargo hakari manage-deps
```

### Updating dependencies

```bash
# Update all dependencies
cargo update

# Update specific dependency
cargo update -p serde

# Update to specific version
cargo update -p tokio --precise 1.35.0

# Regenerate hakari after updates
cargo hakari generate
```

### Upgrading to new major versions

1. Edit `Cargo.toml`:
```toml
[dependencies]
clap = "4.0"  # was "3.0"
```

2. Update and regenerate:
```bash
cargo update -p clap
cargo hakari generate
```

### Removing dependencies

1. Remove from `Cargo.toml`
2. Regenerate hakari:
```bash
cargo hakari generate
cargo hakari manage-deps
```

### Adding exclusions to workspace-hack

**Important**: You can only exclude dependencies that already exist in your dependency graph. To add exclusions:

1. First ensure the dependency exists in at least one crate in your workspace
2. Add the exclusion to `.config/hakari.toml`:
```toml
# Only add exclusions for dependencies that actually exist
[final-excludes]
third-party = [
    { name = "criterion" },    # Only if criterion is used somewhere
    { name = "proptest" },     # Only if proptest is used somewhere
]
```
3. Regenerate hakari:
```bash
cargo hakari generate
```

**Note**: Hakari will error if you try to exclude dependencies that don't exist in your workspace. Only add exclusions for dependencies you actually use but want to keep out of workspace-hack (like test-only or benchmark-only dependencies).

## Best practices and common patterns

### Workspace organization patterns

**For library-focused workspaces:**
```toml
# .config/hakari.toml
output-single-feature = false  # Default, conservative
[final-excludes]
workspace-members = ["examples", "benches"]
```

**For application-focused workspaces:**
```toml
# .config/hakari.toml
output-single-feature = true  # More aggressive unification
platforms = ["x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu"]  # Production target only
```

### When to regenerate

Always regenerate after:
- Adding/removing dependencies
- Changing feature flags
- Updating dependency versions
- Modifying hakari configuration
- Merging branches with dependency changes

### CI/CD integration

```yaml
# .github/workflows/hakari.yml
name: Verify workspace-hack
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  hakari-check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: dtolnay/rust-toolchain@stable
      - name: Install cargo-hakari
        uses: taiki-e/install-action@v2
        with:
          tool: cargo-hakari
      - name: Check workspace-hack is up-to-date
        run: cargo hakari generate --diff
      - name: Verify all crates depend on workspace-hack
        run: cargo hakari manage-deps --dry-run
```

### Handling merge conflicts

Never manually resolve conflicts in workspace-hack/Cargo.toml:

```bash
# After merge conflict
git checkout --theirs Cargo.lock  # Or resolve Cargo.lock first
cargo hakari generate  # Regenerate from scratch
git add workspace-hack/Cargo.toml
git commit
```

## How hakari works under the hood

### The three-phase algorithm

**Phase 1: Build Simulation**
- Simulates builds for every workspace package
- Tests with no features, default features, and all features
- Captures results for each configured platform
- Uses guppy's Cargo build simulator

**Phase 2: Feature Conflict Analysis**
- Identifies dependencies built with multiple feature sets
- Computes the union of all feature sets for conflicting dependencies
- Creates initial set of dependencies requiring unification

**Phase 3: Fixpoint Iteration**
- Iterates until reaching stable solution
- Checks if adding dependencies creates new conflicts
- Continues until no new conflicts arise

### Technical architecture

```rust
// Simplified algorithm representation
for package in workspace_packages {
    for platform in target_platforms {
        for features in [none, default, all] {
            simulate_build(package, platform, features);
            record_dependency_features();
        }
    }
}

// Unify conflicting features
for (dep, feature_sets) in dependencies {
    if feature_sets.len() > 1 {
        unified_features = union_all(feature_sets);
        workspace_hack.add(dep, unified_features);
    }
}
```

## Common issues and troubleshooting

### Build errors after setup
**Solution:** Ensure `resolver = "2"` in workspace Cargo.toml

### Dependencies out of sync
```bash
# Verify state
cargo hakari verify

# Fix by regenerating
cargo hakari generate
cargo hakari manage-deps
```

### Publishing issues
```bash
# Option 1: Use hakari publish
cargo hakari publish -p my-crate

# Option 2: Temporarily disable
cargo hakari disable
cargo publish -p my-crate
cargo hakari generate
```

### Debugging commands
```bash
# Explain why dependency is included
cargo hakari explain serde

# Show what would change
cargo hakari generate --diff

# Verify configuration
cargo hakari verify
```

## CI/CD pipeline integration

### GitHub Actions complete example

## CRITICAL DEPENDENCY RULES - READ CAREFULLY

**⚠️ NEVER add dependencies to these files:**
1. **Root `./Cargo.toml`** - NO dependencies go here, only workspace configuration
2. **`./workspace-hack/Cargo.toml`** - This is AUTO-GENERATED, never edit manually

**✅ Correct dependency workflow:**
1. Add dependencies to individual project `Cargo.toml` files as normal
2. Run `cargo hakari generate` to auto-update workspace-hack
3. Run `cargo hakari manage-deps` to ensure all projects depend on workspace-hack
4. Common dependencies used by multiple projects will automatically appear in workspace-hack
5. Dependencies used by only one project will NOT go in workspace-hack (this is correct)

**🚫 Exclusions workflow:**
1. Only exclude dependencies that already exist in your workspace dependency graph
2. Add exclusions to `.config/hakari.toml` in the `[final-excludes]` section
3. Run `cargo hakari generate` to apply exclusions
4. Hakari will error if you try to exclude non-existent dependencies

**📝 Example:**
```bash
# Add dependency to a specific project
echo 'reqwest = "0.11"' >> my-project/Cargo.toml

# Regenerate workspace-hack (this updates workspace-hack/Cargo.toml automatically)
cargo hakari generate

# Ensure all projects depend on workspace-hack
cargo hakari manage-deps
```
